constructor does not have any return type in Java.

Constructor looks like method but it is not. It does not have a return type and its name is same as the class name. Mostly it is used to instantiate the instance variables of a class.

If the programmer doesnâ€™t write a constructor the compiler writes a constructors on his behalf.
